# Race---Game-for-Kids
A prototype of a simple game for children. Game mechanics allow you to implement different modules in place of colored beans to collect (you can collect other assets, for example numbers or letters). This game is a mix of different ideas (e.g. from Ketra Games), which I put together, looking for my own solutions and creating something new.
